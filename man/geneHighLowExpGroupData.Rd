\usage{
geneHighLowExpGroupData(
  data,
  gene,
  surv_cols = c("vitalStat", "surTime"),
  Timeunit = 1,
  group = c("quartile", "median")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing clinical information, gene expression data, and survival data.}

\item{gene}{Character string. Name of the gene to analyze (must correspond to a column name in `data`).}

\item{surv_cols}{A character vector of length 2 specifying column names for survival data: first element is survival status (event indicator, 0/1), second is survival time. Defaults to `c("vitalStat", "surTime")`.}

\item{Timeunit}{A single positive numeric value specifying the conversion factor for survival time units (e.g., use 30 to convert days to months). Defaults to 1 (no conversion), and survival time will be divided by this value.}

\item{group}{Character string specifying the grouping method for gene expression. Options are "median" (split by median expression) or "quartile" (split by 25th and 75th percentiles, with middle samples excluded). Defaults to "quartile".}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns: survival status, survival time (converted), gene expression, and a `group` column (factor with levels "Low" and "High").
}
\description{
This function processes input data to group samples into high/low expression groups 
based on specified methods (median or quartile), and prepares survival data by 
converting time units and removing missing values.
