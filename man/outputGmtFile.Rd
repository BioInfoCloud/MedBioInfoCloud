\title{Generate a GMT file from gene set data}
\usage{
outputGmtFile(input, description = NA, folder = ".", filename)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{A data frame or named list containing gene set information:
- If data frame: Must have at least two columns. First column = gene set names (terms),
  second column = genes in each term. Additional columns are ignored.
- If named list: Each element is a character vector of genes; list names = gene set terms.}

\item{description}{Character vector of descriptions for gene sets. If shorter than the number of gene sets,
descriptions will be recycled. If `NA` (default), empty strings will be used.}

\item{folder}{Path to directory where the GMT file will be saved. Creates directory recursively if it doesn't exist.
Defaults to current working directory (".").}

\item{filename}{Name of the output GMT file (e.g., "pathways.gmt"). Recommended to use ".gmt" extension.}
}
\value{
No return value; writes a GMT file to the specified path.
}
\description{
This function converts gene set data (data frame or named list) into a GMT (Gene Matrix Transposed) file,
with validation and cleaning steps to ensure data integrity. It removes empty values and invalid entries
to produce a standard-compliant GMT file.
}
\details{
The GMT format requires each line to follow: `term<tab>description<tab>gene1<tab>gene2<tab>...`
  This function ensures:
  - Duplicate genes within a set are removed
  - Empty gene sets (after cleaning) are skipped with warnings
  - NA values and empty strings in gene lists are filtered out
  - Proper handling of descriptions (recycling and empty value replacement)

\examples{
# Example 1: Data frame input
df <- data.frame(
  term = c("GO:0001", "GO:0001", "GO:0002"),
  gene = c("GeneA", NA, "GeneB"),  # Contains NA (will be filtered)
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
outputGmtFile(
  input = df,
  description = c("Cell cycle", "Signal transduction"),
  folder = "output",
  filename = "test_genesets.gmt"
)

# Example 2: Named list input
gene_sets <- list(
  "GO:0001" = c("GeneA", "GeneB", ""),  # Contains empty string (will be filtered)
  "GO:0002" = c("GeneC", NA)            # Contains NA (will be filtered)
)
outputGmtFile(
  input = gene_sets,
  filename = "test_genesets.gmt"
)
