\title{Calculate Gene Weight Matrix Based on Reference Expression}
\usage{
gene_ref_weight_mt(marker_ls, marker_reccur)
}
\arguments{
\item{marker_ls}{List of cell type-specific marker genes (names = cell types, values = gene vectors).}

\item{marker_reccur}{List from `marker_times_count()` (gene names as keys, associated cell types as values).}
}
\value{
Gene weight matrix (rows = marker genes, columns = cell types). Values are normalized weights.
}
\description{
Internal helper function to compute a gene weight matrix, where weights are proportional to
the expression of each marker gene in its associated cell types.
}
\examples{
# Load built-in reference expression
data("marker_exp")

# Example marker list and recurrence count
marker_ls <- list(Tcell = c("Cd3e", "Cd4"), Bcell = c("Cd19", "Cd4"))
marker_reccur <- marker_times_count(marker_ls)

# Compute gene weight matrix
weight_mat <- gene_ref_weight_mt(marker_ls, marker_reccur)
}
