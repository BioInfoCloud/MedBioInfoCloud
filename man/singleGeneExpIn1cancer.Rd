\title{Generate boxplot and violin plot for a single gene in one cancer type}
\usage{
singleGeneExpIn1cancer(data, cancer, gene, color = c("#E7B800", "#2E9FDF"))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing gene expression data with required columns:
\code{gene} (gene names), \code{exp} (expression values), \code{Sample} (sample groups),
\code{cancer} (cancer types), and \code{id} (sample identifiers)}

\item{cancer}{A character string specifying the cancer type to plot}

\item{gene}{A character string specifying the gene to plot}

\item{color}{A character vector of length 2 specifying colors for the two sample groups.
Defaults to c("#E7B800", "#2E9FDF")}
}
\value{
A list containing two ggplot2 objects: \code{violin} (violin plot) and \code{boxplot} (boxplot)
}
\description{
This function creates both boxplot and violin plot (with embedded boxplot) to visualize
the expression of a specific gene in a specific cancer type, including statistical testing.
